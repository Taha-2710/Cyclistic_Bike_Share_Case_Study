# Data Overview
This analysis uses Cyclistic’s historical bike-share trip data provided by Motivate International Inc., consisting of approximately 5.9 million individual trip records. The dataset covers the period from January 2024 to December 2024, providing a complete annual view of bike-share usage.
As first-party operational data collected directly through Cyclistic’s system, the dataset is current and reliable. Due to data privacy constraints, demographic details about riders are not available. Consequently, the analysis focuses on behavioral patterns, which are derived from key trip-level fields such as ride start and end timestamps.
