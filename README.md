Monthly datasets were standardized and merged into a consolidated, validated dataset suitable for analysis.

### Analysis — Rider Behavior Insights

#### Ride Duration & Seasonality
- Casual riders take longer rides, especially during warmer months  
- Members show stable ride durations year-round  

➡ Indicates leisure-driven vs utility-driven usage

---

#### Weekday vs Weekend Usage
- Casual riders peak on weekends  
- Members ride consistently across all days  

➡ Habitual usage defines membership value

---

#### Ride Frequency
- Members complete significantly more trips overall  

➡ Value comes from frequency, not ride length

---

### Key Insight
Casual riders who begin riding frequently — even with short trips — are the strongest candidates for membership conversion.  

**Short rides. Big habits. That’s where the subscription magic lives.**

---

### Recommendations — Driving Membership Conversion

#### 1. Target High-Frequency Casual Riders
Focus on casual riders with repeated usage across weekends or months.  
**Action:** In-app or email-based limited-time membership trials.

#### 2. Position Membership Around Convenience
Emphasize ease, spontaneity, and routine — not just cost savings.  
**Action:** Shift messaging toward everyday usability.

#### 3. Time Campaigns Strategically
Casual riding peaks on weekends and during warmer months.  
**Action:** Run seasonal and weekend-focused conversion campaigns.

> **Right rider. Right message. Right time.**
